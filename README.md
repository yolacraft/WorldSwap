## WorldSwap 1.2 for FabricMC (1.16.1)

WorldSwap is a challenging yet fun Minecraft speedrun challenge that resets the world at configurable intervals while preserving your inventory and other player data.

### Installation
Fabric Loader **0.18.1 or newer** and the **Fabric API** are required.  
The [Speedrun API](https://github.com/contariaa/SpeedrunAPI/releases/tag/v2.0%2B1.16.1) is recommended for configuration (default interval: 5 minutes).

### Usage
Simply create a world and start playing.
After the configured interval, a new world will automatically be generated.  
You can change the configuration using the Speedrun API menu (**Options → Book and Quill**).

### Feedback
I am always open to feedback. Discord: @yolacraft (dms open)
